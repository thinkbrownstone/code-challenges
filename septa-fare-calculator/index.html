					Compound this with the usability issues that selective display might create for someone who is using a screen reader.  I don't know how that person would detect that the fare-calculator-note changed without visiting it repeatedly.

					Comment on the following fare calculations:

					Review of fares.json indicates:

					* travel_time = weekday and purchase_location = advance_purchase is always fares[0].
					* travel_time = weekday and purchase_location = onboard_purchase is always fares[1].
					* travel_time = evening/weekend and purchase_location = advance_purchase is always fares[2].
					* travel_time = evening/weekend and purchase_location = onboard_purchase is always fares[3].

					This simplification allows me to use ng-if to test for
					specific combinations of user choices and do relatively
					simple calculations directly in the HTML, instead of creating a more complex directive that finds the correct fare in the JSON object assuming it is unordered.

					If fare calculation logic were completely implemented in a directive, then having a multiple of 10 fares would display a multiple of the 10 trip, anytime, advance_purchase price, unless the intent was to purchase onboard.

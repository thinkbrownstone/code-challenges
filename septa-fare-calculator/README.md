# SEPTA Rail Fare Calculator Challenge Submitted by Ayush

Thank you for letting me take this coding challenge. This is my submission.
I've used javascript for scripting, and within the time-limit of 60 minutes, I managed to
complete the logic, and added some rudimentary styling.

Given more time, my next steps would have been to align the image and heading. Then I would have gone
ahead with styling each segment(section) of the widget. Next would probably have been font-family and 
responsiveness, followed by helper-text integration.

## Septa Rail Fare Calculator Challenge


Welcome to my solution to the Fare Calculator Challenge where I got to exercise my JS skills. I got to utilize ES6 in which I am becoming more comfortable adapting from vanilla JS. 

However, I did include a snippet of code showing how I could connect to the JSON file with AJAX, primarily to demonstrate that I am also able to achieve the same result with the oh-so flexible Javascript. 

### Instructions: 

Fill out each option to allow the app to calculate the fare with the selected options.

Enjoy!

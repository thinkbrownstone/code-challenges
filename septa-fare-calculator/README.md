This challenge was fun!  I did take longer than the allotted hour - I spent about two hours on this.  I was going to give up, but I kept coming back to it - it is a fun puzzle.

Definitely lots of things that I would have liked to improve.

I used [FastShell](https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell) as a quick building base.  I like to use that as a really fast base - not having to rewrite the gulp tasks and having some pre-set SCSS structure is really helpful.

# SEPTA Rail Fare Calculator Challenge -- My Submission

Thank you for taking the time to look over my code. I chose to complete the challenge via React component. See septa-fare-calculator/src/FareCalculator.js for my component and septa-fare-calculator/src/FareCalculator.css for my styling rules.

I spent about 3 hours on this.

The trickiest bit was handling the "Anytime" tickets, especially handling ticket number inputs for "Anytime" tickets that are not multiples of 10 (I assume that these tickets can only be purhased in multiples of 10, given their description in the JSON file).

Look forward to talking with y'all!

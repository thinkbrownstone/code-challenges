I used 'create-react-app' and 'styled-componets' to create this app.
There's some left over from that such as the favicon and manifest but that could be updated later.
The app.css and index.css are purposefully left blank as they are needed for build but not for actual runtime as the styled components handles that.

To get it started just kick off yarn install and then yarn start and should be good to navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Possible next steps:

Implement polyfill/babel for I.E. and older browsers (as the instructions asked for it)

Implement buying anytime tickets in groups of 10 maybe?

Reformat options in to readable text

Update arrow styles on dropdown

Reformat to make more modular and extensible

Update actions to use functional programming

Unit tests and snapshots :)

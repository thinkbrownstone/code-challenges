Hi, this is Robert Mruczek (rtmruczek@gmail.com). Here's my solution to the challenge.

This solution is an npm package. It makes use of webpack, React.js and redux, and it employs json-server to host the json file locally. To open the widget, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
open ./dist/index.html
```

Thanks!
